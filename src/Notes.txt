I want to make a clarification - add a control COM port on a board for connection with TS-50

it is necessary to make an optoelectronic isolation from the TS-50. In the transceiver, the COM port inputs go directly to the processor and without isolation it is possible to burn these inputs

three more optocouplers are needed to isolate the signals on COM port - Tx, Rx and CTS.
